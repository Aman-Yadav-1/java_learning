# Problem

Given an array of integers. All numbers occur twice except one number which occurs once. Find the number in O(n) time & constant extra space.

Example : 

Input:  ar[] = {7, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4}
Output: 7 

Three approaches:
1. Using Xor
2. Using sum of array
3. Using Binary Search Algorithm
